--- How to add a new language ---

To add a new language you need to do 2 things inside this folder.
Let's take an example with the Italian language: "it".

1. Add an 'it.json' file in this folder and translate all the fields from 'en.json' (default)

2. Add "it" in the '_language.json' file -> "supported_languages"

3. (Optional): if you want to make Italian the default language,
change the "default_language" field to "it".

Repeat this process for any new language you want to add.

--> If a new Niryo Studio version is released, you just have to do those steps
again (copy/paste your existing translation files), and update the new fields.
